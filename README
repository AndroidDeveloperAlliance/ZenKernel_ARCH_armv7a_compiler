GCC Toolchain for ZenSERIES Kernels
-----------------------------------
Readme won't be updated frequently, but these are pretty constant.
- Just a stable build of GCC
- Built with crosstool
- Default crosstool-ng patches and optimizations applied
- Built with VFP intrinsics, armv7 tune
- Gentoo patches applied to the binutils/mpfr/gmp/etc. used to build GCC and GCC itself

If you have any other questions, feel free to contact
Android Developer Alliance or bbedward.

Don't be a tool like knzo "metal apocolypse i'm probably 10 years old"
